      I've got a lot of fans, but I say friends, because every time I meet a fan
      somewhere around the world, I don't consider them a fan; I consider them
      as a friend. <br /><br />
      If you live day by day and do the best you can, then you'll have a great
      future. If you worry about the future, and you don't live the best day,
      you're not going to have a future. <br /><br />
      I try to motivate people and inspire them, to let them know that they're
      not alone. <br /><br />
      I have always been a martial arts fighter; it goes to back when I was
      eighteen. I was competing on the circuit, but when you're performing, you
      tend to pull punches because you don't want to hurt anyone.</em

    <h2>My farewell</h2>
    <p>
     On November 20, 2022, we lost our hero and idol due to death by suicide. I
     never had a chance to meet with my childhood hero in person but news about
     his death did put some tears in my eyes. Even now, while I write this,I
     hope you are in some better place right now and free of your demons. You
     will always be in the hearts of your family and all people that loved you
     and still love and admire you. You will not be forgotten. May you rest in
     peace and love.
